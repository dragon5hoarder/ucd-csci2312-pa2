# Programming Assignment 2
####PA2 POINT and CLUSTER CLASS

This program has updated the Point class and added another class called Cluster.<br>
In the Point class I added a function to give it a limitless amount of dimensions.<br>
I also overloaded all of the operators to compare two different points and use simple arithmetic on each Point.<br>

Within the new Cluster class I added a function to hold a series of Points.<br>
These Clusters can add in new points or remove them.<br>
They can also create unions and differences between different clusters, as well as comparing each point within the cluster.
