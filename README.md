####PA3 Implementation of STL and Temmplates

This program has updated the Cluster class and added another class called KMeans.<br>
KMeans takes in a user specified int k, a file filled with points( each dimension seperated by a ','), and a specified dimension.<br>
KMeans then takes all the points and stores them into k clusters.<br>
Each cluster holds a uniqe point, grouped based on their distance to each other.<br>
KMeans then creates a text file called output, which displays each point and which cluster they belong to.<br>
I also allowed to print out the centroid of the cluster, for testing purposes.<br><br>

####Compiler
I have used the gcc compiler within clion and cygwin.<br><br>

####Errors
Ive updated this code the best as I could.<br>
It worked perfectly until I added the templates to it.<br>
So here it is in all its glory.
